# Discoded

Discoded is a full stack live chat and community application made to resemble the popular gaming chat app Discord.
The backend is comprised of Ruby on Rails and PostgreSQL and the frontend uses React and Redux.
Live text and video chat, direct messages, channels, and servers with randomly generated invite code were all implemented and styled over the course of 10 days.
